# GraphicX

Just some graphics programming with Rust for now, possibly with the objective of writing a tutorial later using the resulting code. Starting with DirectX 12, the plan is exploring all the other low-level graphics APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan and Metal) as well.

## TODO

* Write main D3D12 graphics backend
* Write main game loop framework, timer, main app, and then implement example in terms of it
